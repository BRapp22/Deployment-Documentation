Pull request from each branch into main branch.
Use Tags to mark changes with version numbers.
Check Tags to ensure that the proper versions have been applied to the main branch.
Once the main branch is tested and stable, apply the new version to the production environment.
If done in incremental updates, there should be no issues with the production environment.
